### Structure of the paper

1. **Introduction to Cross Device Tracking**: Provide a clear understanding of CDT, including its definition, purpose, and an exploration of various techniques employed.
2. **Data Collection and Analysis**: Collect HTTP-Archives and analyze them with focus on quantifying third-party domain requests linked to CDT and examining the nature of data transmitted to these third parties in terms of origin, frquency and purpose. We also try to investigate wether the user behavior and influences the type of advertising on another device.
3. **Follow-up Questions and Comparative Analysis**: To add depth, we propose exploring a follow-up question, such as comparing CDT on different types of websites, for example the results of 10 news websites vs 10 social media websites. Conducting cross-country or cross-platform comparison could also lead to interesting results. This segment aims to bring out interesting insights from a comparative standpoint.
