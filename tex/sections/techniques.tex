\subsection{Deterministic Tracking}
Deterministic matching relies on known and verified user data, such as login information or email addresses, to connect devices. This method is more accurate than probabilistic matching but requires users to log in across multiple devices.

\subsection{Probabilistic Tracking}
This method involves using various data points such as IP addresses, device types, browser fingerprints, and user behavior to create a probabilistic match between different devices.
